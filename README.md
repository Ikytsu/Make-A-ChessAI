# Chess-AI

Some tools to help you making your chess-AI

## Needed dependencies:
matplotlib
chess
cairosvg

## quick tutorial
modify the ai.py on the main directory to make your ai, using chess import

## Tools
tools are in the misc directory
### Training tools
#### training.py 
it's here to make your AI play against other AI for example, if you want your AI to fight stockfish or other python made AI (see README.md in the usef and usei directory) you can, it will generate tons of svg files.
You can run python training.py to see all commands associated by that:
-usei [against_ai_name]
-usef [against_ai_name]
-starter [true/false]
-debug

-usei is for executable engines, for example stockfish, you will need to manually add stockfish bin to the directory
-usef for python bots
-starter is to make your AI play first or not
-debug is for describing everything

For -usei and -usef don't forget to check README.MD on the both directories.

#### party-visualizer.py
it's to see the game generated by training.py with a matplotlib gui, pretty easy to use

### Playing tool
running main.py will permit you to play against your AI, the gui is really intuitive too, some lags are here but it's still ok to use
